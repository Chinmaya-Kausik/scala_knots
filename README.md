# Scala_Knots

Implementing various link algorithms in scala, starting with obtaining the Standard and Generalized Seifert Matrices of a colored link from its braid description.

## Instructions

1. To use the program, download the contents of the GenSM folder into a single folder (to download a file, either open it on GitHub and look for the Download button, or just pull from this repository if you are a more experienced git user).  
**Note:** If you don't use Windows, don't download "rungensm".
2. Make sure you have Java installed (check [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp)).
3. If you use a Windows system, open the folder and click on "rungensm".
4. If you use Linux, go to the Bash shell and type "java -jar <filePath>/gensm.jar".
5. If you use Mac OS X, just double click on "gensm".
6. You can also download files from "link_files" for some braid descriptions. All braid descriptions with their corresponding multivariate Alexander polynomials available on LinkInfo are given in the file LinkInfoBraids.
